This is a template for developer to start a koa rest project quickly.
This is a back-end project totally.

### router

### middleware

### controller

### service

### model
I didn't define it, you can use mongoose, mysql and everyone you prefer to.

### auth
Based on json web token instead of http session, you can see the source code in `/src/service/user-service.ts/login/` and `src/middleware/require-login.ts`
